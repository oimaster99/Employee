# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This software is an employee management system. It is designed to store the names, emails, phone numbers, and state of the employee. This then gets stored to a database, where these employees can be accessed, or removed. The purpose of this software is solely for documenting employees.

This project I felt would be a good one to do if I could do it on a small scale. I want to upgrade it in the future.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
